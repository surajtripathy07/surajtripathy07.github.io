Hi! I'm Suraj, a code ninja who loves building products.

I've been coding since 2015 and have worked with a variety of languages and technologies, including Java, Ruby, Python, Nodejs, Objective-C, and Android. I'm a generalist, so I'm always up for learning new things.

I've worked in both small startups and large corporations, and I've seen the product development process from start to finish. I have a keen eye for the end product and work well with Product Managers and Designers. I've also managed a team of junior developers for a year.

When I'm not coding, I'm a happy husband and father. I love listening to audiobooks in my spare time. I also enjoy playing chess.
