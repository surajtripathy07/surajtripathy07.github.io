title: About
---

Building Products using code since 2015. I think of myself as a generalist
in terms of language and technology. I have professionally worked with
Java(J2EE), Ruby(ROR), Python(Django), Nodejs(Express), Objective-C, Android.

I have worked in a small team startup and have seen it grow into a big
corporation. I have a keen eye for the end product and work really well when 
paired with a Product Manager. I have managed a team of junior developers for
a year. 

When I am not working on code, I am a happy husband and father. I love to listen
to audiobooks in my spare time. I like playing chess, though I do try to keep it
within limits of 15 minutes per day. I mostly play bullet chess.
