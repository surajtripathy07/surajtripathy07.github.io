## Procrastination and Me
Procrastination and I have been long friends. Our romance had been "on" even
before I knew what Procrastination meant. Waiting until the last moment to
really work on something. Putting something off 'for tomorrow', or 'the next
hour', or 'right after I have some tea', or 'just after this YouTube video',
and the most recent ones but 1000 times more toxic one's 'just after this next
reel/short'. If I try to think back over my earlier years, I can clearly
remember one science class in school (don't remember the grade, maybe 6th?)
where I had not done my homework and the teacher was going around the class
collecting homework. I remember my fear while she was coming towards my desk, I
remember acting all frantic and trying to locate the homework in my bag in
front of the teacher. I remember lying that I have done the homework but have
forgotten it at home and then apologizing profusely, promising that I will get
it tomorrow.Â I was playing the day before and had decided to do the homework
later, and had forgotten all about it until dinner. Because I had gone out to
play after telling my parents that there was no homework, I hardly could have
admitted that there is something now. So I slept, and the next day the event
took place. If you are wondering, why didn't I just do it without telling my
parents, it is because I couldn't have done it without them knowing. We lived
in a one Room kitchen, and we were always under my mother's and later at night
even my father's watchful eye. I think that is my earliest memory of
Procrastination. It also puts light on parenting at our house while I was
growing up, I don't wish to alarm people into thinking I was subjected to
cruelty, I was loved by my parents. But they were particularly strict about
education and homework! I have come a long way since 6th grade, and still the
problem has stayed.

## Source of Procrastination over the years
As the years has gone by, and with the advent of smartphones the problem had
multiplied (at least for me). Back in the day (pre smartphone era), my fallback
for procrastinating was usually to read some fiction novels, or go out to play.
There were odd times when I would just lie down and do nothing, but that was an
exception rather than the rule. And being limited in my resources I did not
have unlimited books to read from. I did not even have the energy to play all
day so I used to, commonly, rule out my distractions fairly easily and come
back to things that really needed doing. TV time was controlled by my parents,
so I couldn't have had unlimited TV hours. I did not have a personal computer
until very late in my life, and even when I did get a personal laptop when I
was in my 12th grade, internet then wasn't as enticing and addictive as it has
now become. I think it was also the fact that in India even until the early
2010s internet and laptops were not a norm for every household. We used to,
commonly visit cyber-cafe's to do something on the Internet and had to pay 10Rs
per hour to access emails or even use Orkut and Facebook. Orkut was the rage
when I was in 11th and soon Facebook became the new rage by the time I reached
college. But procrastinating on the internet was not feasible due to lack of
infrastructure and even opportunities. With the advent of smartphones and the
rise in social media, in a span of 10 years everyone now has access to internet
24x7. The threshold to simulate your mind which back in the day involved
reading or playing, has now transformed into swiping over my mobile device and
watching a short video. I don't think reading a fiction novel is better than
watching Instagram reel, but I do think focused reading takes effort and
energy, and the mental simulation is a more involved activity where you are
actively imagining a world and working with characters as the story progresses.
Whereas while watching a reel, the simulation is instant and the effort it
takes on your end is negligible. So it isn't a surprise we find people getting
addicted to these reels and YouTube shorts. The threshold to "simulate" your
mind has reduced drastically. It is easier to scroll Instagram and give
yourself the dopamine boost than it is to give the same dopamine boost by
finishing a task. Instagram or YouTube or TikTok or twitter aren't the only
place where this happens, I have personally done this on LinkedIn and some
popular News websites!

## Becoming aware of the Problem
A few years ago, I started to notice a pattern in my life where I would avoid
working on difficult tasks, sometime for weeks and would spend most of my time
on social media. It was during the time I was pursuing my remote masters and
every other week we had assignments. During the same time in my office, I had a
lot of deliverables assigned to me, since I had changed my team and the
pressure to gather context and become productive was overwhelming. I started
getting stretched to my limit with so much to do and having to prioritize
things daily. I ended up most of the week not doing anything, spending time in
meetings, spending time on my phone, and having to work crazy hours to meet
commitments by the end of the sprint, and then having to work overnight for
college submissions. After 3 months, I started realizing that it is a problem
and I need to figure out a solution for this. I had not suffered because of
this, either in my job or in my college assignments, because I did meet my
commitments or would have an honest explanation on times I could not. But every
time it did happen, I wondered why did I allow things to come to this. And yet
the next time I was there again, having to finish lots of things in a span of
few days.

## Instrumentation
I was conscious that I was wasting my time, but I wasn't sure how much in
actual numbers. And I wasn't even clear about my reasons for wasting time. I
have always enjoyed problem-solving and coding, and I was required to do just
that. And still I was finding myself in a position where I would regret my
behavior after 2 weeks. After 2 week of conscious observation, I realized that
the problem is twofold.

1. I had a lot to do, there was lack of clarity in what I should do
first, and figuring things out, planning and prioritizing was not easy.
2. It was easier to distract myself by using my phone, and looking at some
memes, or chatting with some friends or helping others figure their task out.

I also realized that I was spending upwards of 5 hours per day on my phone. I
was spending hours playing Chess. I was spending hours browsing YouTube and
Instagram. I used Android's Digital wellbeing to get the statistics. So I was
wasting time using my phone as my primary source of distraction. I thought that
may be working on my distraction will make me more focused and in turn will
solve even the 1st problem.

## Digital Wellbeing

Android has a very awesome feature called Digital Wellbeing. It allows you to
monitor and even control the time you spend on your phone. You can use it to
limit the amount of time you can open an app, and also use it to disable apps
all together during specific windows or after certain minutes/hours of usage.
It wasn't an easy change, my mind would rebel against myself. My phone usage
had become a habit. I had to resist my urge to disable the settings all
together. I realized that after blocking apps, I was spending more and more
time on websites, where even though my phone usage had dropped, but I was still
spending significant time on my phone. After some changes, I started using this
feature even on websites, no more 9gag for me after 20 mins, no more Hacker
news for me after 15 minutes, no more Google News after 10 minutes. I felt like
a tyrant to myself, but I reasoned that it is self-discipline. After some
months I realized my habits had changed, I wasn't spending so many hours on my
phone, I even removed the entire thing once my phone changed, only to find that
slipping into those bad habits are very easy, so I added back the limitations.
I started using this feature primarily to limit unwanted usage during office
hours. But having used it for over four years, I think I am now a power user of
the feature, and I also use it to limit my phone usage after I am home and to
ensure I am not obsessively checking my Emails, or to ensure I don't stay on my
phone post 11pm.

## Todo

But the important question was, did the Digital wellbeing really solve my
procrastination problem? Not entirely, I hoped that removing distracting would
solve both my problems, and to some extent it did, but I had to still work on
the bigger problem of prioritization. Because of my Digital control, I started
having more and more focused hours. I started getting more work done during
those times, but there were still sometimes where I would not work on the task
at hand. I understood that the reason for that was lack of clarity and no clear
direction of execution. I was convinced that I had to establish a routine and
"define" it to remove ambiguity from my day-to-day prioritization. After some
trial and error over a period of months, I came up with the following execution
Paradigm.

I realized that my work usually has 3 stages to it.
1. Unknown: These tasks require doing, but are unbounded. It is unrestricted
and Unknown. The scope is not clear. It involves research and is not
straightforward. Sometimes it might involve defining the problem itself.
2. Straightforward: These are task that are just execution. Well-defined and
known. These are task you could spell out for someone to do.
3. Monitor/Discussion

I realized I procrastinated the most on the `Unknowns`, so I decided that every
day I will spend the first few hours on the Unknowns. I will try to define
them, break them, scope them into either smaller `Unknowns` or
`Straightforwards`. If I need to collaborate with someone to figure it out, I
would work on it till I can independently and move it to `Monitor/Discuss`.
After the first few hour(2 hours, in my case) of this. I move my energy to
Straightforward, and because of the nature of work here, these get churned
without much thought. This is pure execution, with very less problem-solving.
Between multiple `Unknowns` I always pick the one which I feel is the most
important for today, unless explicitly priority has been defined by the
stakeholders.

At the end of the day during meetings and discussions I will update the tasks
in my `Monitor/Discussion` section and move them back to either `Unknown` or
`Straightforward`

Here is a sample Todo list categorization which I use
```
## Order of execution

1. First work on the Unknowns and try to move them to **Straightforward** or
**Monitor/Wait for Reply**
2. Then work on **Straightforward** and move them to **Wait for Reply**

### Unknown ð¯ð
- [ ] Superbase vs Firebase, or Native Server?
- [ ]

### Straightforward ð¯
- [ ] Fix StandardError during Storage limit breach
- [ ]

### Monitor/Wait for Reply ð
```

## Results

The above approach has helped me get focused and avoid procrastination by
defining a routine to approach my work daily. It is still a Work in Progress but
I have reduced the amount of time I ended up spending browsing the web because
of lack of focus. I have not stopped using social media all together, I have
just defined a place and time where I intend to do just that, as opposed to
doing it every other minute of the day. It has increased my overall personal
satisfaction from my work and my leisure!
