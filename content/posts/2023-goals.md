Hello future self, and people who have way too much time at their hand. This is an attempt by me
to start getting into the blogging game again. I have given this a lot of try historically, and have
found it difficult to stick to it. Well I could say that "found it difficult to stick to it", is the story
of my life, but one cannot fault me for trying. As one of the most iconic fiction character once said, 'Doing better next time, that's what life is.' So here I am trying to do better this time.

Its pretty late in the year to really start planning or listing out 2023 goals, but its better late than
never. I am going to look at it from a Financial year perspective, as we are still "technically" in April
which is the first month of the next financial year. I haven't given this a lot of thought so this might
end up becoming quiet a big draft. I did create a goal for myself in 2022, but 2022 wasn't a "normal" year
for me. So most of the plans of 2022 either got discarded, or someone(a wailing someone) stole the thunder and prioirity for most of the year. Having checked off mariage, changing a job, baby, buying an apartment all in the span of 15 months has been quiet a ride, and I have mostly stumbled my way across most of the decisions. It would be nice to have a plan again, and it would be nice if I could try and have some measure of predictability in the upcoming year. I think it would be nice to break my aspirations into various buckets.

So I have broadly the following roles Professional, Parent, Personal, Spouse.
